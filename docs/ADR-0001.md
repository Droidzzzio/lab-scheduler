# ADR‑0001 — Tracks, Credits, Slots, Approval (Final)
**Date:** 2025‑09‑19

## Context
Training company with CCIE Security & Data Center tracks. Students book racks. Privacy, credit accounting, and a 72h cancellation lock are required.

## Decision
- Tracks: **Security** (4h slots, 1600 credits, racks 1–3) and **Data Center** (3h slots, 900 credits, module required: Nexus/UCS/ACI, single rack)
- Registration collects **track** & **exam date**; user is `pending` until **admin approval**; approval email; only `approved` can log in
- Credits = 10 credits/hour → Security **40/slot**, DC **30/slot**; refunds on student cancel ≥72h; <72h no refund by default
- Prevent double‑booking using unique `(resource_id, date, slot_idx, status)` where only a single `confirmed` row may exist
- Students never see who booked; trainers/admins do
- **Timezone**: IST (Asia/Kolkata)
- **Database**: **MySQL 8.0**

## Consequences
- Track differences captured via `track_policies`, resource rows, and (for DC) `bookings.module`
- Credit ledger is the authoritative history for audits/refunds
- Approval gate ensures verified track access before login
