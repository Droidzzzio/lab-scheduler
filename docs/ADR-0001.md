ADR-0001 — Tracks, Credits, Slots, Approval

Date: 2025-09-19

Context

We’re a training company focused on CCIE tracks. Students book racks for exam practice. Privacy, credit accounting, and a 72h cancellation lock are required.

Decision

Two tracks initially: Security (4h slots, 1600 credits, racks 1–3) and Data Center (3h slots, 900 credits, module required: Nexus/UCS/ACI, single rack).

Registration collects track & exam date; user is pending until admin approval; approval triggers email; only approved can log in.

Credits: 10 credits/hour baseline. Security: 40/slot. DC: 30/slot. Ledger is the source of truth. Refund full slot credits on student cancel ≥72h; no refund <72h by default.

Booking uniqueness: one confirmed booking per (resource_id, date, slot_idx); partial unique index.

Privacy: students see “Booked” only; trainers/admins see names.

Timezone: Asia/Kolkata across UI, DB, ICS, emails.

DB: PostgreSQL for staging/prod.

Consequences

Track differences live in DB via track_policies and resource/module design.

Ledger enables audits and future pricing (peak/off-peak).

Approval gate avoids unauthorized access before trainer verifies the track.
